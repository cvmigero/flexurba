# flexurba 0.2.0

* New `apply_threshold()` identifies urban areas by applying a threshold on grid cells.

* New `convert_regions_to_grid()` convert regions from a vector layer to gridded format.

* New R package [`flexurbaData`](https://flexurbadata-ac82f4.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) with global datasets accompanying the Flexurba R package. The package includes processed population and built-up area derived from the [Global Human Settlement Layer](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/download.php), and night-time light grid derived from the [Earth Observation Group](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnl/#annual_v2). 

* New `load_proxies_belgium()` loads a sample of the proxy datasets in `flexurbaData` for the country of Belgium.

* Two new vignettes: (1) `vignette("vig8-apply-thresholds")` discussing different thresholding approaches and (2) `vignette("vig9-different-proxies")` on different proxy datasets used to construct urban boundaries.

* The functions that were specifically design to reconstruct the *Degree of Urbanisation* delineation have been renamed with the prefix `DoU_` to make a more consistent API and allowing for a better tab-completion. The old names remain available for backward compatibility.

* The standard grid parameters for semi-dense urban clusters in `DoU_get_grid_parameters()` have been updated to reflect the modifications made to the DEGURBA methodological manual in July 2024. Specifically:
  * the minimum density threshold (`SDUC_density_threshold`) increased from 300 to 900 inhabitants per kmÂ²
  * the minimum size threshold (`SDUC_size_threshold`) decreased from 5000 to 2500 inhabitants 
  * the contiguity rule (`SDUC_contiguity_rule`) is modified from the queen (=`8`) to rook (=`4`) contiguity
  * the buffer size for semi-dense urban clusters `SDUC_buffer_size` is adjusted to 2 km
<br/><br/>
* The function reference is restructured and the README, function documentation pages and vignettes are modified to reflect the updates.
